This is an ugly hex player.

As of 07/13/16, the game plays against itself (random moves) until the board is full and has no win checking.

At least you can make the board any size you want (with the caveat that it must be square, which is for your own good anyway), but if you make it bigger than 26, it stops labelling columns with letters and uses whatever ASCII characters comes after Z.
